# Cupix RESTful API

## Introduction

This is a repository about how to use the cupix RESTful API. If you contact us, we can serve our API document file(openapi.json) so that you test our API in other application which is Postman, or Insomnia, etc. The APIs in this document are kept as up to date as possible.

In the near future, we plan to provide a web service where APIs like other applications can be described and tested.
